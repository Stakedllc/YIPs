## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the YIP.-->
dYdX is a decentralized margin trading platform built on Ethereum. When accounts on dYdX reach a certain collateralization threshold, liquidators can come in and repay the borrow in exchange for a 5% premium. 

The following is a clear explanation of the liquidation process from [dYdX](https://github.com/dydxprotocol/liquidator):

Liquidations on Solo reward a 5% spread on top of the current oracle prices for the assets being liquidated and used as collateral. Example:

Undercollateralized Account:

+2 ETH
-350 DAI

Liquidator Account:

+100 ETH
-1000 DAI

Oracle Prices:

ETH Oracle Price: $200
DAI Oracle Price: $1

Fully liquidating this account would cause 350 DAI to be paid to zero out its balance, and would reward 350 DAI * ($1/DAI / $200/ETH) * 1.05 = 1.8375 ETH as payout. After the liquidation the account balances would be:

Undercollateralized Account:

+0.1625 ETH
0 DAI

Liquidator Account:

+101.8375 ETH
-1350 DAI

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.-->
The liquidation opportunity must be described in a smart contract with the opportunity interface in order for RAY to consider it and allocate funds when a liquidation opportunity arises. 

## Motivation
<!--The motivation is critical for YIPs that want to change the RAY protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the YIP solves. YIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->
Liquidations offer a new source of return for RAY. Liquidations can be incredibly lucrative, as illustrated by the 5% premium offered by dYdX.

## Yield Evaluation
<!--The potential added value for extra yield generation. Historical data should be provided. The process used to evaluate the yield potential should be detailed here.-->
The 5% premium is clearly a yield-boosting opportunity. [Historical data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B13YheapGlqJ4ij1030kdQ2MfA4iy9d41PoLP1Q_OQU/edit?usp=sharing) previously pulled by [Devan](@dpurhar27). More to-do here.

## Risk Evaluation
<!--The potential or attached risk that should be considered for this proposal. Historical data should be provided. The process used to evaluate the risks should be detailed here.-->
Since the liquidation can be undertaken in one atomic transaction, there is limited risk to this strategy. There is a risk in the gas-war process, however.  

## Specification
<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature.-->
The specification for this YIP will need to be explored further. Do we want to specify a new standard interface for liquidation opportunities? Or, similar one-block opportunities? For example, the 'getBalance' and 'withdraw' functions don't neccesarily fit within the liquidation paradigm. 

## Rationale
<!--The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->
Liquidations can be a low-risk way for RAY to add alpha.

## Backwards Compatibility
<!--All YIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The YIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. YIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.-->
To-do.

## Test Cases
<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for YIPs that are affecting consensus changes. Other YIPs can choose to include links to test cases if applicable.-->
To-do.

## Implementation
<!--The implementations must be completed before any YIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the YIP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.-->
To-do.

## Security Considerations
<!--All YIPs must contain a section that discusses the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for security discussions, surfaces risks and can be used throughout the life cycle of the proposal. E.g. include security-relevant design decisions, concerns, important discussions, implementation-specific guidance and pitfalls, an outline of threats and risks and how they are being addressed. YIP submissions missing the "Security Considerations" section will be rejected. An YIP cannot proceed to status "Final" without a Security Considerations discussion deemed sufficient by the reviewers.-->
To-do.
